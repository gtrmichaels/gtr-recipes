    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Combine vinegared rice with your favorite fillings, roll up in seaweed, and slice.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients for Sushi:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sushi nori (seaweed sheets)</li>
            <li>Your favorite sushi fillings, such as cooked fish, shellfish, vegetables, and avocado</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Procedure</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice according to package directions.</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl and stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, spread it out on a sheet pan and drizzle with the rice vinegar mixture. Use a spatula to fold the rice and vinegar mixture together until the rice is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>To assemble the sushi, place a sheet of nori on a bamboo rolling mat. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Add your favorite fillings to the center of the rice. Using the bamboo rolling mat, roll up the sushi tightly, starting from the bottom and working your way up. Wet the 1-inch border of nori with water to seal the roll.
            <li>Use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into 6-8 pieces. Serve with your favorite dipping sauces, such as soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.</li>
        </ol>
